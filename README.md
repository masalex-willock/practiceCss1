# DESCRIPTION FOR WHY THIS WAS CREATED

I have been doing CSS for a while but was generally stuff for single sections but encountered real problems when trying out full sites or even a full webpage. I have created this repository to add projects of recreation. I acquire a cool photo off the internet and recreate with hope of making myself better.

Note: This will work better with later versions of your browser that support stuff life CSS variables and calc() CSS functions.

Also from tutorials, getting the knowledge from there and using it to create a personalized site from that information.

Hopefully I will upload content every 3 days.
